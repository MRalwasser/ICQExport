ICQExport
=========

Minimalistic ICQ message history HTML exporter (prior to ICQ 2003b)
Works directly on the database file, no ICQ installation required.

Currently only tested with ICQ2000b database files, however, it should work with all versions >=99 and <2003b).
If not, let me know or do a PR.

Quick start
===========

1. Download https://github.com/MRalwasser/ICQExport/blob/master/ICQExport/ICQExport.jar?raw=true
2. Execute downloaded jar file (java required)
3. Choose ICQ database file (often inside C:\Program Files\ICQ\2000b\ )
4. Wait until export finished (browser will be opened)
